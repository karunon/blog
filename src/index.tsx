          My name is Karunon. I'm a designer that live in Japan, not a
          programmer. I don't have any works yet because I've only just entered
          this industry. My dream is to fill this site in the future.

          Design is incredibly challenging. On weekdays, my mind always feels
          like it's about to explode. Recently, I've been slowly learning about
          UX and a11y (accessibility)â€”progressing at the pace of a snail.

          Programming is like therapy. Even for someone who constantly makes
          mistakes, the compiler always shows the right path.
